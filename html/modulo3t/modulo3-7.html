                            Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out,
                            it could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the
                            senate. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now
                            she is my only link to find their secret base!
                            She'll die before she tells you anything. Leave that
                            to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the
                            senate that all aboard were killed! Lord Vader, the
                            battle station plans are not aboard this ship! And

                            joints are almost frozen. What a desolate place this
                            is. Where are you going? Well, I'm not going that
                            way. It's much too rocky. This way is much easier.
                            What makes you think there are settlements over
                            there? Don't get technical with me. What mission?
